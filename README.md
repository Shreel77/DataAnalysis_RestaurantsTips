# DataAnalysis_RestaurantsTips

This Power BI project analyzes customer tipping behavior at a restaurant to uncover key insights into how bill amount, day, server, payment type, and group size influence tipping trends.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of average tips, tipping percentage, and customer behavior patterns, enabling better understanding of factors that drive generous tipping.

Objective:
To explore tipping behavior patterns and identify trends and factors like Do higher bills lead to higher tips?, Which days and servers receive the best tips?, Does payment type (Cash vs Credit) affect tipping?, How does group size influence tip percentage? 

Key features :
Some Kpi cards , visulas and insights and interactivity slicers.The ANOVA test was applied to examine:Whether average tip percentage differs significantly across days of the week, If servers have statistically different average tipping rates, Whether payment type (Credit vs Cash) affects tip amounts
